# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Performing `Retrospective, Statistical Analysis` on Car Manufacturing Datasets: Designed `Hypothesis Testing` with ` R`.
--

## Challenge Overview
---

1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
2. Collect Summary Statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically diffrent from the mean population .
4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers in conjunction with summary insights based on results.

## Study Design: MechaChar vs Competition
---
<brief intro to study design and though process behind usefullness to production>

2. Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer:
	- examples: cost, city or highway fuel efficency, horse power, maintenance cost, saftey rating.
3. In your description, address the following questions:
	- What metrics are you going to test?
	- what is the null hypothesis or altnernaive hypothesis?
	- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
	- What data is neeeded to run the statistical test?
